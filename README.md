### What I Learned

- How to center a component vertically and horizontally using Flexbox
- Responsive design principles using `max-width` + `width: 100%`
- How to apply hover effects cleanly with transitions
- How to structure HTML semantically using `<article>`, `<h2>`, and `<span>` appropriately
- Git basics: staging, committing, pushing, force-pushing to a GitHub repo

```css
.card__title a:hover {
  color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
  transition: color 0.2s ease;
}
